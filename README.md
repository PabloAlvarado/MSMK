# MSMK

Mat√©rn Spectral Mixture (MSM) kernel for Gaussian process models applied to pitch detection in polyphonic music signals, using Python and [GPflow](https://github.com/GPflow) (version 0.5.0).

This code provides a complement to the arxiv paper: Efficient Learning of Harmonic Priors for Pitch Detection in Polyphonic Music ([pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07104)), by Pablo A. Alvarado, Dan Stowell.
